README INSTRUCTIONS 

My scripts run in this order (with etl.sh being the main script to run all other scripts):

etl.sh etl0.sh  etl1  etl1a.sh  etl2  etl3  etl3a.sh  etl4.sh  etl5  etl6.sh  etl7  etl8 etl9.sh and mysqlimport(to run the database)

Here is an example of running my etl.sh that runs all other scripts (it takes in 5 parameters):
./etl.sh kbrown52 161.31.72.29 /fall2018/MOCK_MIX_v2.1.csv.bz2 csstudent maxdb

A description of what each script does and how it should be ran individually on the command line is listed below.
And I hope everthing is clear and made easy for you to process my project.  Thank you it's been a pleasure getting
to know you this semester and I hope to keep up with you on LinkedIn!  Much success! -Kima
